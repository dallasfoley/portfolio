        Hi, I'm Dallas, a recent MSU graduate who studied Mathematics and
        Computer Science and now specializes in frontend web development. I
        enjoy building websites in React.js with TypeScript and prefer Tailwind
        as a styling solution for its flexibility and ease of customization. I
        am also very interested in the union of static site generation and
        server-side rendering and particularly how it can enhance performance
        and search engine optimization and have hence been delving into Next.js.
        In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and channeling my creativity
        into songwriting. I also enjoy diving into the competitive world of
        League of Legends and spending quality time with my friends and cat,
        Piplup.
