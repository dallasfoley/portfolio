        Hi, I'm Dallas, a recent MSU graduate who studied Mathematics and
        Computer Science and now specializes in fullstack web development. I
        enjoy building websites in React.js with TypeScript on the frontend and
        prefer Tailwind as a styling solution for its flexibility and ease of
        customization. I'm comfortable writing backend code in a Node / Express
        or Spring Boot ecosystem. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and
        channeling my creativity into songwriting. I also enjoy diving into the
        competitive world of League of Legends and spending quality time with my
        friends and cat, Piplup.
