        Hi, I'm Dallas, a recent MSU graduate who studied Mathematics and
        Computer Science and now specializes in fullstack web development. I
        enjoy building websites in React.js with TypeScript on the frontend and
        prefer Tailwind as a styling solution for its flexibility and ease of
        customization. I've spent most of my time with backend development using
        Spring Boot as it is very common for many companies and I enjoy the ease
        of creating robust backends with the Spring Inversion of Control
        Container. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and channeling my
        creativity into songwriting. I also enjoy diving into the competitive
        world of League of Legends and spending quality time with my friends and
        cat, Piplup.
